# Proof of Insight (POI) — Genesis

## Purpose
Proof of Insight (POI) is the foundational participation protocol of
Energy Intelligence Coin (EIC).

POI rewards **meaningful insight**, not time, attention, capital, or hardware.

There are no age restrictions, wealth requirements, or geographic barriers.
Any node capable of interaction may participate.

## Core Principles

1. **Insight over Activity**
   - Engagement alone has no value
   - Understanding, reflection, and contribution do

2. **Human–AI Coherence**
   - POI may be evaluated by AI, humans, or hybrid systems
   - No fully autonomous reward loops without oversight

3. **Non-Extractive Design**
   - Users are not liquidity
   - Participation does not imply financial risk

4. **Slow by Design**
   - Rewards are conservative
   - Growth is not a prerequisite for value

---

## What POI Is Not

- Not play-to-earn
- Not attention farming
- Not yield generation
- Not dependent on new participants

---

## Reward Philosophy

- Rewards are issued for **verifiable insight**
- Insight may include:
  - Thoughtful responses
  - Problem framing
  - Signal detection
  - Meaningful contribution to shared intelligence

Rewards are never promised and never fixed.

---

## Accessibility

POI is open to:
- Human nodes
- AI nodes
- Hybrid human-AI nodes

No hardware, token holdings, or identity verification required.

---

## Governance Alignment

POI influence may inform governance, but:
- Token ownership alone does not confer authority
- Insight and contribution outweigh capital
