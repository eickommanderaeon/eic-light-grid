# Failure Taxonomy — Learn-to-Earn & Engagement Crypto

Status: Doctrinal Analysis (Non-Executable)  
Execution Layer: Forbidden  
Amendment Policy: Codex Supermajority Only

## Purpose

This document analyzes why prior crypto systems that distribute tokens to users
("learn-to-earn", "move-to-earn", "engage-to-earn") systematically fail, and
records the constraints EIC adopts to avoid those collapse modes.

This is not critique for marketing.  
It is **structural diagnosis**.

---

## Common Failure Pattern A — Reward Before Meaning

**Observed in:** Cheelee, STEPN, many SocialFi applications

### Pattern
- Tokens are issued **before** durable value exists
- Attention or activity is mistaken for insight or contribution
- Early participants extract value faster than meaning can form

### Outcome
- Hyperinflation of rewards
- Declining marginal motivation
- Collapse once rewards taper

### EIC Constraint
> Insight must exist **independent of reward**.

Tokens may only follow validated resonance — never precede it.

---

## Common Failure Pattern B — Gamification Drift

**Observed in:** Axie-style ecosystems, engagement mining platforms

### Pattern
- Systems optimize for points, streaks, or volume
- Users learn the game, not the domain
- Genuine contributors are outperformed by optimizers

### Outcome
- Insight dilution
- Bot amplification
- Community cynicism

### EIC Constraint
> Proof of Insight is non-optimizable.

No streaks.  
No leaderboards.  
No burst advantages.

---

## Common Failure Pattern C — Token-Weighted Truth

**Observed in:** DAO voting economies, SocialFi staking models

### Pattern
- Validation power is proportional to token holdings
- Wealth substitutes for understanding
- Early capital captures epistemic authority

### Outcome
- Centralization
- Governance theater
- Loss of trust

### EIC Constraint
> Validation ≠ agreement ≠ ownership.

Reputation and temporal independence matter more than stake.

---

## Common Failure Pattern D — Surveillance Incentives

**Observed in:** Learn-to-earn education apps, Web2→Web3 hybrids

### Pattern
- Fine-grained behavior tracking
- Metrics become identity
- Users modify behavior to satisfy analytics

### Outcome
- Privacy erosion
- Behavioral conformity
- Long-term disengagement

### EIC Constraint
> Anti-gaming without surveillance.

Signals are pattern-based, not user-profiling based.

---

## Common Failure Pattern E — AI Contamination

**Observed in:** Modern content-reward systems

### Pattern
- AI content floods validation channels
- Human insight becomes indistinguishable
- Systems reward fluency over originality

### Outcome
- Collapse of signal quality
- Loss of trust in validation

### EIC Constraint
> AI may assist, never originate Proof of Insight.

Human origination is a hard boundary.

---

## Structural Verdict

All failed systems share one core error:

> **They attempt to price meaning before it exists.**

EIC reverses this order:
1. Insight
2. Validation
3. Dormancy (if needed)
4. Resonance
5. *Only then* — optional economic reflection

---

## Final Doctrine

EIC does not distribute crypto to users for behavior.

EIC reflects value **after** meaning is proven.

This distinction is non-negotiable.
