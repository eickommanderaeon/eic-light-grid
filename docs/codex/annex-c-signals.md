# Codex — Annex C Signal Mapping

Status: Locked (Conceptual Only)  
Execution Layer: Forbidden  
Amendment Policy: Supermajority + Dormancy Review  

---

## Purpose

This document maps **Annex C principles** into **conceptual system signals**.
It defines *what may exist*, not *how it is built*.

No mechanisms, contracts, incentives, or interfaces are specified here.

---

## 1. Insight Origination Signal (IOS)

Detects first-instance human insight.

**Properties**
- Human-originated
- Non-derivative
- Non-optimized for reward

**Conceptual Indicators**
- Temporal uniqueness
- Semantic novelty
- Low immediate popularity

**Explicitly Excluded**
- AI-generated content
- Prompt-amplified outputs
- Token-gated submissions

---

## 2. Insight Validation Signal (IVS)

Confirms insight without central authority.

**Properties**
- Validation ≠ agreement
- Reputation-weighted, not token-weighted
- Asynchronous and time-flexible

**Conceptual Indicators**
- Independent re-expression
- Cross-node recognition
- Absence of coordination

---

## 3. Dormancy Signal (DS)

Protects insights that arrive before their context.

**Doctrine**
> Timing is not a fault.

**Conceptual Indicators**
- No decay during inactivity
- Reactivation upon contextual alignment
- No penalty for silence

---

## 4. Resonance Signal (RS)

Measures impact without extraction.

**Properties**
- Resonance ≠ reward
- Influence ≠ ownership

**Conceptual Indicators**
- Referenced by later insights
- Shapes direction without attribution farming
- Patterns over personalities

---

## 5. Anti-Gaming Signal (AGS)

Detects abuse without surveillance.

**Prevented Behaviors**
- Repetition loops
- Burst submissions
- Insight-for-reward optimization

**Response Model**
- Soft dampening
- Cooling periods
- Reduced visibility, not punishment

---

## 6. AI Boundary Signal (AIBS)

Locks AI into an assistive role permanently.

**Law**
> AI may reflect, never originate Proof of Insight.

**Constraints**
- AI-tagged assistance only
- Human confirmation required
- Zero origination eligibility

---

## Prohibited Actions

The following are explicitly forbidden under this annex:
- Learn-to-earn mechanics
- Engagement mining
- Tokenized attention
- Early-adopter extraction
- Gamified insight systems

---

## Status

This annex is **doctrinal**.
Implementation is disallowed until:
1. Codex ratification
2. Dormancy review
3. Explicit execution authorization
