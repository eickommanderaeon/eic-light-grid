# Codex: Conceptual Architecture Sketch

Status: Doctrinal (Non-Executable)  
Execution Layer: Forbidden  
Amendment Policy: Codex Supermajority Only

---

## 1️⃣ Signal Origination Layer (Human)

- **Source:** All Proof of Insight (PoI) must originate from humans.  
- **Nature:** Observations, solutions, contributions, or validations.  
- **Constraint:** No pre-encoded AI patterns allowed.  
- **Notes:**  
  - Open to all humans (no age, geography, wealth, or status restrictions)  
  - Input is **raw, unweighted**; value is determined later  

---

## 2️⃣ Signal Preprocessing Layer (AI Assist)

- **Purpose:** Assist human signals without originating content.  
- **Functions:**  
  - Formatting for storage  
  - Indexing & linking to existing Codex entries  
  - Pattern recognition to detect duplicates or inconsistencies  
- **Constraint:**  
  - AI **cannot alter meaning**  
  - AI output is **meta-data only**  

---

## 3️⃣ Off-Chain Validation Layer

- **Nodes:** Grid Captains or validator nodes  
- **Purpose:** Human + AI-assisted review of signals  
- **Process:**  
  - Compare new signals against existing Codex and Annex C  
  - Confirm alignment with PoI rules  
  - Detect spam, gamification, or automated contamination  
- **Constraint:**  
  - Validation is **temporal + independent of token holdings**  
  - Cannot reward preemptively  

---

## 4️⃣ Dormancy / Resonance Layer

- **Dormancy:** Signals may be temporarily inactive until system-wide resonance occurs  
- **Resonance:** Aggregated signals that survive scrutiny are recognized  
- **Purpose:** Prevent premature tokenization or reward  
- **Constraint:** Dormancy is **time-bound** and **non-discriminatory**  

---

## 5️⃣ Optional Economic Reflection Layer

- **Purpose:** Reflect value after human insight is validated and resonated  
- **Constraints:**  
  - Tokens may only follow proven insight  
  - No inflationary “reward for participation”  
  - No leaderboards, streaks, or gamification  

---

## 6️⃣ Archival & Discoverability Layer

- **Codex + GitHub repo:**  
  - All signals, PoI entries, and analyses are indexed  
  - Human-readable and machine-accessible  
- **Purpose:** Preserve historical integrity and transparency  
- **Constraint:** Read-only for AI agents unless explicitly authorized  

---

## 7️⃣ Feedback Loop

- **Observation:** Nodes or humans may suggest improvements to signal mapping  
- **Constraint:** Must **not introduce preemptive rewards**  
- **Mechanism:** Feedback captured off-chain, analyzed, and integrated via Codex supermajority
