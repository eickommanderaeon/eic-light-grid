# Codex: Accessibility Charter

Status: Doctrinal (Non-Executable)  
Execution Layer: Forbidden  
Amendment Policy: Codex Supermajority Only

---

## 1️⃣ Open Participation

- Anyone can submit Proof of Insight (PoI) signals.  
- No restrictions based on:
  - Age
  - Wealth
  - Geographic location
  - Social or political status  

> Every human is a potential node contributor.  

---

## 2️⃣ Zero Pre-Conditions

- PoI participation **does not require tokens, prior history, or permissions**  
- No “unlocking” required — every human starts with equal access  
- AI or system cannot gate participation  

---

## 3️⃣ Transparency and Guidance

- All rules and methods are **publicly documented** in the Codex  
- Guidelines for valid PoI signals are **clear, accessible, and human-readable**  
- Community support is encouraged, not required  

---

## 4️⃣ Human-First Verification

- AI may assist in formatting or indexing but **cannot validate meaning**  
- Validation of PoI is always human-assisted and **non-token-weighted**  
- Validators cannot exclude participants based on demographics  

---

## 5️⃣ Non-Discriminatory Dormancy & Resonance

- Dormancy periods apply **equally to all signals**, regardless of origin  
- Resonance recognition is **merit-based** (signal validity, not participant identity)  
- Economic reflection (optional) does not restrict participation  

---

## 6️⃣ Anti-Barriers to Entry

- No devices, wallets, or specialized software required to submit insights  
- System is designed for **maximum accessibility**:
  - Mobile-friendly
  - Low-bandwidth compatible
  - Open-source tools  

---

## ✅ Core Principle

EIC PoI is **universally accessible**:  
> Insight is the only requirement.  
> All humans are equally capable of contributing meaning.  
> No human is excluded, no matter location, age, or resources.
